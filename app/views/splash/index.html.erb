* Enter email address and password.
* If you are associated with a shelter or distribution center, we especially ask that you please sign up. Email us as well to harveyneedsnow@gmail.com to share your affiliation.


#### FIRST CHECK IF THE LOCATION EXISTS IN THE DATABASE!

* Use the Search bar (right, above table) to check if the location is already listed.
